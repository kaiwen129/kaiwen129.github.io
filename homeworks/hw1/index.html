        <li>Chipotle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Part 2</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I learned to pause and take time to observe the design of an app everytime I open it. This will help me better understand the intention behind design choices.</li>
        <li>My favorite part was when she pointed out the search bar's placeholder text. Having "Try 'London'" instead of something generic like "Search here" makes the user excited about traveling.</li>
        <li>"When I started off in design, I sucked."</li>
        <li>9</li>
    </ol>
