					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that typography should be purposeful and reflect the intention of your design. This is because text is the primary form of communication between designer and user. For instance, for a landing page, the font should be simple and not distract the user from the rest of the page. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part was when the author talked about audience. I learned that certain fonts are easier to read for certain audiences. It was surprising to learn that even children have preferred typography for reading.</p>
