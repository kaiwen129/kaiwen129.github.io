                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned about how various creative transitions can improve the user experience. For instance, in the Add to Cart interaction for Norde, the designer adds a smooth transition that gradually applies a color change when a different color is selected. This lets the user focus on the visual change that occurs on the shoe.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part was the Welcome screen by Andrej Radisic. It has a clean background video playing on the main screen that sets the vibe for the app. Then, when the user taps on login, a smooth transition brings up the login screen.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>The Welcome screen by Andrej Radisic and the Nike Add to Cart interaction by Dannniel were my favorite. Both had very clean transitions that brought the user's attention to the visual change that took place. This was achieved by a creative animation rather than just a moving element. The entire aesthetics of both were also very clean and free of distraction. </p>
